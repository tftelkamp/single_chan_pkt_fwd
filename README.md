*** IMPORTANT ***

Please note this repository is deprecated, and the code is not up-to-date to use on The Things Network.

This repository will not be further maintained. Please find another repository if you want to deploy a single channel gateway.

Single Channel LoRaWAN Gateway
==============================
This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a single
channel LoRaWAN gateway.

It has been tested on the Raspberry Pi platform, using a Semtech SX1272
transceiver (HopeRF RFM92W), and SX1276 (HopeRF RFM95W).

The code is for testing and development purposes only, and is not meant
for production usage.

Part of the source has been copied from the Semtech Packet Forwarder
(with permission).

Features
--------
- listen on configurable frequency and spreading factor
- SF7 to SF12
- status updates
- can forward to two servers

Not (yet) supported:
- PACKET_PUSH_ACK processing
- SF7BW250 modulation
- FSK modulation
- downstream messages (tx)

Dependencies
------------
- SPI needs to be enabled on the Raspberry Pi (use raspi-config)
- WiringPi: a GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835
  used in the Raspberry Pi.
  sudo apt-get install wiringpi
  see http://wiringpi.com
- Run packet forwarder as root

Connections
-----------
SX1272 - Raspberry

3.3V   - 3.3V (header pin #1)
GND	   - GND (pin #6)
MISO   - MISO (pin #21)
MOSI   - MOSI (pin #19)
SCK    - CLK (pin #23)
NSS    - GPIO6 (pin #22)
DIO0   - GPIO7 (pin #7)
RST    - GPIO0 (pin #11)

Configuration
-------------

Defaults:

- LoRa:   SF7 at 868.1 Mhz
- Server: 54.229.214.112, port 1700  (The Things Network: croft.thethings.girovito.nl)

Edit source node (main.cpp) to change configuration (look for: "Configure these values!").
