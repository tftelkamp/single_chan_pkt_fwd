Dual Channel LoRaWAN Gateway
==============================
This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a dual
channel LoRaWAN gateway.

It has been tested on the Raspberry Pi platform, using a Semtech SX1272
transceiver (HopeRF RFM92W), and SX1276 (HopeRF RFM95W).

The code is for testing and development purposes only, and is not meant
for production usage.

Part of the source has been copied from the Semtech Packet Forwarder
(with permission).

Maintainer: Thomas Telkamp <thomas@telkamp.eu>

Was forked by @jlesech https://github.com/tftelkamp/single_chan_pkt_fwd to add json configuration file    
then forked by @hallard https://github.com/hallard/single_chan_pkt_fwd 
then forked by @bokse001 https://github.com/bokse001/dual_chan_pkt_fwd to add dual channel support, 
    configurable network interface and uputronics Raspberry Pi+ LoRa(TM) Expansion Board

Added new Features
------------------

- Added support for [Dragino Lora HAT][2] and [LoRasPi][1] (more to come) and uputronics Raspberry Pi+ LoRa(TM) Expansion Board
- pin definition are in config file
- Removed some configuration hard coded in source file and put them into global_conf.json
- renamed main.cpp to dual_chan_pkt_fwd.cpp
- added dual_chan_pkt_fwd.service for systemd (debian jessie minimal) start
- added `make install` and `make uninstall` into Makefile to install service
- added control for On board Led's if any (uputronics board CE0 and CE1 activity, Internet and Lan sensing leds)
- added configuration of the network interface (eth0/wlan0) and sensing network interface connectivity
- added a counter for packets received since last start

Raspberry PI pin mapping is as follow and pin number in file `global_conf.json` are WiringPi pin number (wPi colunm)
